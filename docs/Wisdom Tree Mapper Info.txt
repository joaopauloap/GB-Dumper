The Wisdom Tree mapper is triggered by writes in the 0x0000-0x3FFF area.
The address written to determines the bank to switch in in the 0x000-0x7FFF address space. This mapper uses 32KB sized banks.

Name checks for all 00's between 0x134 and 0x14C to identify Wisdom Tree games, I have done this here as well.

0x600 contains a unique byte value for each game
Spiritual Warfare	  -	0x79
NIV Bible		        -	0x78
King James Bible	  -	0x00
Joshua			        -	0x05
Exodus			        -	0x7C

I combine these two methods to detect all 5 Wisdom Tree cartridges, although I can only test Spiritual Warfare.
